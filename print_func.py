#The print() Function:

#The print() function is a built-in Python function used to display a specified message in the console window.
#Unlike user-defined functions, built-in functions are always available without needing to be imported.
#Python 3.8 includes 69 built-in functions, which can be found in the Python Standard Library.

#Function Invocation and Arguments:
#To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses.
#You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses, separated by commas.
#An empty print() function outputs a newline to the screen.

#String Delimiters and Special Characters:
#Python strings are enclosed in quotes (either double or single).
#The backslash (\) is a special character in strings, indicating that the next character has a different meaning (e.g., \n for a newline).
#Instructions and Programs:
#Computer programs consist of instructions—commands executed to perform specific tasks.
#For example, using print() to display a message on the screen.

#Positional and Keyword Arguments:
#Positional arguments’ meanings depend on their position (e.g., second argument follows the first).
#Keyword arguments’ meanings are identified by special keywords, not position.

#Customizing Output with end and sep:
#The end parameter controls what appears at the end of a print() statement (default is a newline).
#The sep parameter specifies the separator between outputted arguments (e.g., print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-")).
